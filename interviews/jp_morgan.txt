1) givaen the code:

#include <iostream>

int global = 0;

void foo()
{
  int local = global;
  local++;
  global = local; 
}

for(int index = 0; index < 10; index++)
  foo();


//we have 10 threads, each iterating the function 10 times, what are the largest and smallest possible value of global ?

//smallest is 2, in the following scenario:
//thread 10th  runs until line 10;
//thread 9th runs 9 iterations 
//threads 1-8 all runs until they end,
//thread 10th complete it's first iteration so now global = 1;
//thread 9th runs it's last iteration until line 10 so it has local=2
//thread 10th complete all of his iterations 
//thread 9th complete it's last iteration and set global=2
  
//write a function that reverse the order of words in a string with
O(n) time and O(1) space

//"Hello_World_Ni ce_To_Meet_You" --> "You_Meet_To_Nice_World_Hello"
 
int reverse_words(char* s, sz){
  reverse(s, sz);
  int k = 0;
  for(int i=0;i<sz;i=i+k){
    k=i;
    while(k<sz && s[k] != '_')
      k++;
    reverse(s+i,k-i);
  }
}

int reverse(char* s, int sz){

  char c =0;
  
  for(int i=0;i<sz/2;i++){
    c = s[sz-1];
    s[sz-i-1] = s[i];
    s[i] = c;
  }

}
